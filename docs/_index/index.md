# Your HPI Maker Universe

The HPI Maker Universe is a test space for new educational services and maker technologies that is in House K on the Ground Floor.

The Spaces are open for all HPI students, researchers and employees. Our opening hours are Mondays to Fridays between 9:30 AM and 5:30 PM. Talk to us, if you need help makeruniverse@hpi.com

## Getting Started

The best way to start your maker journey is by joining our guided tours that take place every Tuesday 10:00AM in the Maker Universe in House K (Ground Floor). Grab a coffee and get to know the space with us!

## Guided Projects

HPI Students created intruiging prototypes that you can re-build by following our guided tutorials - you can start anytime and at your own pace! Start with a small project.
