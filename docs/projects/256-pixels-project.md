# 256 Pixels by Luca

In this project, you will build a RGB Pixel display running and based on [awtrix](https://github.com/Blueforcer/awtrix3).

In the end you will finish your own version of the clock. You will receive a bag with all components you will need during the build. This text and some videos will tell and show you everything what you need to know. You will need 3D printers, the laser cutter and soldering.

## Getting Started

In the Maker Studio, in Shelve x, you can find "256 pixels" packages that contain all materials to start building your own display right away. Follow our tutorial and get support by our experts if you need one. 

## Introduction

256 pixels is a LED screen in a case that you can ...

## Printing The Grid

In this video we will guide you in using Orca Slicer to prepare the STL model of the case for the Bambu X1 printer in our Maker Studio. 

## Laser Cutting the Front

In this video we will show you how to laser cut a frosted glass screen that covers the 256 LED lights of your prototype. Using the Laser Cutter requires you to participate in a laser cutter introduction at our Maker Universe.
