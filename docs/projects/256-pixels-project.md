# 256 Pixels

In this project, you will build a RGB Pixel display running and based on [awtrix](https://github.com/Blueforcer/awtrix3).

In the end you will finish your own version of the clock. You will receive a bag with all components you will need during the build. This text and some videos will tell and show you everything what you need to know. You will need 3D printers, the laser cutter and soldering.
