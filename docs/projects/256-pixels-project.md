# 256 Pixels by Luca

In this project, you will build a RGB Pixel display running and based on [awtrix](https://github.com/Blueforcer/awtrix3).

In the end you will finish your own version of the clock. You will receive a bag with all components you will need during the build. This text and some videos will tell and show you everything what you need to know. You will need 3D printers, the laser cutter and soldering.

## Introduction

## Printing The Grid

In this video we will guide you in using Orca Slicer to prepare the STL model of the case for the Bambu X1 printer in our Maker Studio. 

## Laser Cutting the Front

In this video we will show you how to laser cut a frosted glass screen that covers the 256 LED lights of your prototype. Using the Laser Cutter requires you to participate in a [introduction into our laser cutter](../tools/laser-cutter.md) at our Maker Universe.
