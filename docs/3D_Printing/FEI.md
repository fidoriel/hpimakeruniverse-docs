# Frequently Encountered Issues

## PLA Warping on Bamboo Carbon X1

The Bamboo has a Snakehouse Fan Duct, which is a bit too close to the bed, on the left of the enclosure. If thin/fragile parts are located on the left side of the bed, near to the edge, they might warp due to the fan blowing on it. If that happens disable the AUX Fan and print with open enclosure. ![OrcaSlicer AUX Fan Settings](../3D_Printing/3dp/img/auxfan-orca.png)
This might also apply for other printers with a similar fan duct.
