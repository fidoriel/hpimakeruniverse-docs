Our longterm goals and the tiny indicators of progress.

## SMART Goals

SMART is the acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.

In its current state (05/24), the HPI defined SMART goals to increase employee satisfaction, improve scientific excellence and create societal impact.

Our SMART goals are focused on engaging students creating a unique hands-on-learning experience.

### #1: Student Learners

Our goal is to educate **50 students** in learning how to apply maker technologies by 31.12.2024. 

Our maker team will accomplish this goal by offering education sessions. Accomplishing this goal will create an impact on student satisfaction at HPI, measured through a Net Promoter Score.
Students will receive a digital badge for their participation. This enables them to introduce tools to other students (peer-learning-concept).

### #2: Student Educators

Our goal is to guide **10 students** to become educators for other students by 31.12.2024.

Our team will accomplish this goal by actively promoting and introducing students in front of their peers. Accomplishing this goal will create a new peers-based and hands-on education experience.
Student educators will receive a certification and a documentation of their accomplishments.

## Key Performance Indicators

KPIs will help us to detect, (1) how many students and researchers engage with our learning environment, (2) to what degree they participate in our educational offers, and (3) how they perceive the quality of our offers.

### #1: No. of daily visits

Rationale: The number of daily visits indicates how well known and how attractive the Maker Universe is to HPI students, researchers, and staff.

Method: We will track ingoing persons via a POS Retail version based on light such as systems by Sensmax. These systems do not track individuals and are therefore GDPR-compliant.

Limitations: The number of daily visits is not a qualitative indicator. People can come in and leave soon without having achieved anything meaningful. Also, at days, only a few visitors may come in, but these visits may have lasting impacts on their projects.

### #2: No. of active learners

Rationale: The number of active learners in our own educational offers during a semester is an indicator on how attractive our education offers are to students, researchers, and staff.

Method: We will track participation numbers in our workshops and summarize results per semester.

Limitations: Our offers are not mandatory. Students may appreciate certain offers but simply cannot participate due to time conflicts. Therefore, participation numbers do not adequately reflect a general interest in maker education offers.
