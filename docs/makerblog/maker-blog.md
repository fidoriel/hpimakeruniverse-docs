Tiny Reflections: The Wins and Lessons from Maker Projects.

## 2024

### Schelling Points

Imagine this scenario: You are in New York. You are supposed to meet a stranger in the city within the next 24 hours, without any chance to communicate with them. 

Where do you go? And when?

It turns out that people are likely to end up on top of the Empire State Building at Noon.

In this thought experiment, the Empire State Building serves as a [Schelling Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtW-Ds-artA). The existence of Schelling Points indicates that coordination without communication is possible.

Now, imagine this: You are part of a product team developing a revolutionary AI-powered user experience with no buttons or interfaces.Everything is speech-controlled. Identifiying the Schelling Points in your product experience will determine whether your users are captivated or simply lost. (HR) <br /> <br />

### Jobs to be Done 

As users, we don't want to own products. We need them to get a job done. It's always about getting from A to B.

Accomplished product teams know their users' A and their B. And the obstacles between them. (HR) <<br /> <br />

### Startups fail

Startups fail. The few that don't are "fat tail events" (Nassim Taleb). They almost never happen, but when they do, they "concentrate all the returns" (Paul Graham). <br /> <br /> 

### Good Ideas look bad

The best ideas initially look bad - even extreme - to almost everyone (Alejandro Lecuna). <br /> <br /> 

### Extreme Users

Extreme ideas are initially appreciated only by "extreme users". Therefore, innovations don't serve mass markets, but create new niches. (HR) <br /> <br /> 

### Makers vs. Schedules (1)

Paul Graham [highlights](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) the clash between a manager's and a maker's schedule. Managers' days are broken up by meetings, and planned by others. Makers, however, work through long, uninterrupted time periods. (HR) <br /> <br /> 

### Makers vs. Schedules (2)

Try to commit a maker to a schedule. Either the maker or the schedule will fall apart. (HR) <br /> <br /> 

### Makers vs. Schedules (3)

Making new stuff is a creative endavour. Neither can you really plan for it, nor can you time it. Therefore, attempts to squeeze in creative work in your schedule will eventually fail. (HR) <br /> <br /> 

### Project Teams vs. Startups

Paul Graham's [blog post](https://www.paulgraham.com/google.html) is a strong reminder that the Googles and Facebooks did not start as startups but as team projects. Groups of individuals with a strong interest in solving a problem. Not with a certain business case in mind.

Google in 1998: How can we fix internet search? 

Failing Startup in 2024: How can we make money out of AI? (HR) <br /> <br /> 

### Constraints

To explore opportunities in the beginning of a project is not an invitation for exuberating concepts. 

When in doubt, go for the opportunity you can make real in 24h rather than in 24 months. (HR) <br /> <br /> 

### Running out of Energy

“Startups don't die when they run out of cash; they die when the founders run out of energy.” (Naval Ravikant) 

In that sense, project teams are no different to startups. (HR) <br /> <br />

### User Research

People in UX as well as in user research tend to evade the term "user" recently. They prefer to talk about and "human-centered" research, and "human-centered" solutions.

Sounds good. But it misses the point. Twice.

(1) The term “user" in "user research" does not refer to a specific target, but to a set of methods. These methods are not exclusively adressing human beings, but also animals. And even more so, [machines](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332636704_Machine_behaviour).

(2) Though, behavioural research [tried to tell us](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) otherwise, user research methods don't reveal the human nature of the actor. They only reveal usage behaviors, hence the name. (HR) <br /> <br />
