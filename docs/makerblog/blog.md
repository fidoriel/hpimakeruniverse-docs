## Jobs to be done 

The purpose of every product is to help someone get a job done.

New products succeed, if they help someone get a job done in a better way.

Most jobs are universal and long lasting: (1) getting from A to B (2) living healthy (3) finding partners (4) reducing stress (5) making decisions, etc.

## Almost all startups fail

Startups fail. The few that don't are "fat tail events" (Nassim Taleb). They almost never happen, but when they do, they "concentrate all the returns" (Paul Graham).

## Good ideas look bad

The best ideas initially look bad - even extreme - to almost everyone (Alejandro Lecuna).

HR

## Extreme Users

Extreme ideas are initially appreciated only by "extreme users". Therefore, innovations don't serve mass markets, but create new niches.

## Makers vs. Shedules (1)

Paul Graham [highlights](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) the clash between a manager's and a maker's schedule. Managers' days are broken up by meetings, and planned by others. Makers, however, work through long, uninterrupted time periods.

HR

## Makers vs. Shedules (2)

Try to commit a maker to a shedule. Either the maker or the shedule will fall apart.

HR

## Makers vs. Shedules (3)

Making stuff is a creative endavour. Neither can you really plan it, nor can you time it, well. Therefore, attempts to squeeze in creative work in a shedule will eventually fail.

## Projects and Startups

Paul Graham's [blog post](https://www.paulgraham.com/google.html) is a strong reminder that the Googles and Facebooks did not start as startups but as team projects. Groups of individuals with a strong interest in solving a problem. Not with a certain business case in mind.

How can we fix internet search? (Google in 1998)

How can we make money out of AI (Random startups in 2024)

## Constraints

To explore opportunities in the beginning of a project is not an invitation for exuberating concepts. 

When in doubt, go for the opportunity you can make real in 24h rather than in 24 months.

## Running out of energy

Angel investor Naval Ravikant [once noted](https://x.com/naval/status/299291360752726016?lang=de): “Startups don't die when they run out of cash; they die when the founders run out of energy.” 

I have always found this observation to be profoundly insightful, and applicable to all sorts of projects.

It all boils down to energy, in the end.

## User Research

People in UX as well as in user research tend to evade the term "user" recently. They prefer to talk about and "human-centered" research, and "human-centered" solutions.

Sounds good. But it misses the point. Twice.

(1) The term “user" in "user research" does not refer to a specific target, but to a [set of methods](../tools/research-tools.md). Turns out, you can not just observe human beings in their user behavior, but also animals. And even more so, [machines](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332636704_Machine_behaviour).

(2) User research methods are clearly limited in scope. An example: we can observe a person in a situation X. That persone decides for option Y over option Z. The methods we have can neither show us why this person decides for option Y. Nor can they tell us more about the human nature of that person. Behavioral psychology tried to make us believe otherwise, and [failed](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) so.
