## Almost all startups fail

Startups fail. The few that don't are "fat tail events" (Nassim Taleb). They almost never happen, but when they do, they "concentrate all the returns" (Paul Graham).

## The best ideas look bad

The best ideas initially look bad - even extreme - to almost everyone (Alejandro Lecuna).

## Extreme Users

Extreme ideas are initially appreciated only by "extreme users". Therefore, innovations don't serve mass markets, but create new niches.

## Makers vs. Shedules (1)

Paul Graham [highlights](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) the clash between a manager's and a maker's schedule. Managers' days are broken up by meetings, and planned by others. Makers, however, work through long, uninterrupted time periods.

## Makers vs. Shedules (2)

Try to commit a maker to a shedule. Either the maker or the shedule will fall apart.

HR

## Makers vs. Shedules (3)

Making stuff is a creative endavour. Neither can you really plan it, nor can you time it, well. Therefore, attempts to squeeze in creative work in a shedule will eventually fail.

## Projects and Startups

Paul Graham's [blog post](https://www.paulgraham.com/google.html) is a strong reminder that the Googles and Facebooks did not start as startups but as team projects. Groups of individuals with a strong interest in solving a problem. Not with a certain business case in mind.

How can we fix internet search? (Google in 1998)

How can we make money out of AI (Random startups in 2024)

## Constraints

To explore opportunities in the beginning of a project is not an invitation for exuberating concepts. 

When in doubt, go for the opportunity you can make real in 24h rather than in 24 months.

## Running out of energy

Angel investor Naval Ravikant [once noted](https://x.com/naval/status/299291360752726016?lang=de): “Startups don't die when they run out of cash; they die when the founders run out of energy.” 

I have always found this observation to be profoundly insightful, and applicable to all sorts of projects.

It all boils down to energy, in the end.

## Are we user-centered or humand-centered?

"User-centered? Haven't we moved beyond that?" A design professor posed this question below my public post about user interviews — not as an actual question but as a "feedback”. She implied that "we" now embrace the term "human-centered" in research and design, leaving "user-centered" in the past.

So, are we talking about users or humans? Debating terms rarely leads to practical outcomes, yet I find it necessary to clarify a potential misunderstanding. When I use the term "user-centered" - do I regard them as "passive subjects" as the professor concluded?

No.

When I use the term “user-centered”, I am referring to the tools and methods we, as researchers, designers, and product managers, apply. Our methods involve field observations, questionnaires, interviews, A/B testing, and recently, technology to monitor brain waves and health indicators. The methods and tools allow us to observe behaviours in a given context. And this level of abstraction, described as user behaviors, is an honest appraisal of our tools.

In fact, it would be presumptuous to imply these tools could help us grasp human beings in their psychological and social complexity. We don’t explore what human beings and their underlying motives are. We explore their behavior as users.
