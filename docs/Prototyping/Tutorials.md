## 3d printing with Vector Files
It's possible to import SVG files into the slicing software, give them a thickness (extrude) and 3d print them.
This works in Pruse SLicer, Orca Slicer & Bambu Studio.

Import your SVG file, the printer will directly show an extruded version with a height of 10mm.
For creating small signs set Z-height to 2mm (uncheck uniform scale) and adjust XY scale as needed.
