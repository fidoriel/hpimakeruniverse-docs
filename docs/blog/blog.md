## Constraints in Projects

A few months ago, I saw a design thinking team presenting a solution to a corporate client. The client's design challenge was to get better customer feedback on their products. What the team suggested was a concept that would require the client to change the culture of the organization - involving almost all teams and management.

The idea was not a result of exuberating creativity. It was just lazy.

To be open and to explore novel solutions to known problems cannot be an excuse for concepts that are way too complex to execute. A better approach would be to find a solution that can be implemented in 24h, not 24 months.



## Running out of energy

Angel investor Naval Ravikant once noted, “Startups don't die when they run out of cash; they die when the founders run out of energy.” I have always found this observation to be profoundly insightful, applicable to almost all sorts of projects.

It all boils down to energy, in the end.

## User Research - and why I still refer to human beings as "users"
"User-centered? Haven't we moved beyond that?" A design professor posed this question at one of public post about user interviews—not as an actual question but as a "feedback”. She implied that "we" now embrace the term "human-centered" in research and design, leaving "user-centered" in the past.

So, are we talking about users or humans? Debating terms rarely leads to practical outcomes, yet I find it necessary to clarify a potential misunderstanding. Am I really regarding human beings as "passive subjects" by using the term "user"?

No.

When I use the term “user research”, I am referring to the tools and methods we, as researchers, designers, and product managers, can apply. Our methods involve field observations, questionnaires, interviews, A/B testing, and recently, technology to monitor brain waves and health indicators. The methods and tools allow us to observe how they react to prompts, and how they use tools in each situation. And this level of abstraction, described as user behaviors, is an honest appraisal of our tools.

In fact, it would be presumptuous to imply that we could even grasp human beings in their psychological and social complexity with these tools. We don’t explore what human beings and their underlying motives are. We explore their behavior as users.
