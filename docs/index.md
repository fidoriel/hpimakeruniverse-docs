# Getting Started

The best way to start your maker journey is by simply visiting us during our opening hours Mondays to Fridays between 9:30 AM and 5:30 PM.

You can also join our guided tour through the Maker Universe that takes places every Tuesday 10:00AM in the Maker Universe in House K (Ground Floor). No need to register.

The Spaces are open for all HPI students, affiliated students, researchers, and employees.

## Project Support

We support HPI students and guest students in realizing their Bachelor-, Master- or individual [projects](./projects/projects.md).

Our further goal is to document intruiging projects as [tutorials](./projects/projects.md) for future students.

## Tools

We offer access to [maker tools](./tools/maker-tools.md) and [media.tools](./tools/media-tools.md) as well as to [experts](./team/team.md).

## Community

Join our Slack Channel HPI Maker Universe and see what your peers are working on. You can find our channel in via hpi.enterprise.slack.com.
