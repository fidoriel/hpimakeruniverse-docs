# Getting Started

The best way to start your maker journey is by joining our guided tours that take place every Tuesday 10:00AM in the Maker Universe in House K (Ground Floor). Grab a coffee and get to know the space with us!

The Spaces are open for all HPI students, researchers and employees. Our opening hours are Mondays to Fridays between 9:30 AM and 5:30 PM.

## Project Support

We support HPI students and guest students in realizing their [projects](./projects/projects.md). These can be Bachelor-, Master- and individual projects. We support by giving access to [tools](./tools/tools.md) and to educational guidance by our [team](./team/team.md).

Our further goal is to document intruiging projects as [tutorials](./projects/projects.md) for future students.

## Tools

We offer access to [maker tools](./tools/maker-tools.md) and [media.tools](./tools/media-tools.md) as well as to [experts](./team/team.md).

## Community

Join our Slack Channel HPI Maker Universe and see what your peers are working on. You can find our channel in via hpi.enterprise.slack.com.
