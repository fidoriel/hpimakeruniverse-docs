# Getting Started

The best way to start your maker journey is by joining our guided tours that take place every Tuesday 10:00AM in the Maker Universe in House K (Ground Floor). Grab a coffee and get to know the space with us!

The Spaces are open for all HPI students, researchers and employees. Our opening hours are Mondays to Fridays between 9:30 AM and 5:30 PM. Talk to us, if you need help makeruniverse@hpi.com

## Project Support

We support HPI students and guest students in realizing their [projects](./projects/projects.md). These can be Bachelor, Master and also individual projects at the intersection of software and hardware. We support by giving access to tools and to experts advice.

Our further goal is to document intruiging projects as tutorials for future students.

## Tools

We offer access to [maker tools](./tools/maker-tools.md) and [media.tools](./tools/media-tools.md) as well as to [experts](./team/team.md)).

## Community
