The best way to **start your maker journey** is by simply visiting us during our opening hours Mondays to Fridays between 9:30 AM and 5:30 PM. Studios are open for all HPI students, affiliated students, researchers, and employees.

You can also join a guided tour every Tuesday 10:00 AM in the Maker Universe in House K (Ground Floor). No need to register.

## Projects

We partner with HPI teams and indivdual students, and researchers to support them in making their ideas real. We also document our [projects](./projects/projects.md) for future students - as an inspiration and an opportunity to re-build prototypes.

## Tools

We offer access to [tools and materials](./tools/tools.md) as well as [experts](./team/team.md) that can teach you how to use them.
