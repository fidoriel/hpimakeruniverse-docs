The best way to **start your maker journey** is by visiting us during our opening hours Mondays to Fridays between 9:30 AM and 5:00 PM. Studios are open for all HPI students, affiliated students, researchers, and employees.

You can also join a guided tour every Tuesday 10:00 AM in the Maker Universe in House K (Ground Floor). No need to register.

## Tools

Our space is packed with [tools](./tools/tools.md) that help you make ideas real at the intersection of hardware and software. You are not alone in this: we have [experts](./team/team.md) that can help you.

## Projects

We partner with HPI teams, students, and researchers in executing on projects. We also document our [projects](./projects/projects.md) - as an inspiration for future students.

## Blog

Our Head of Maker Universe, Holger, is [taking notes](./makerblog/blog.md) on maker projects: tiny observations and lessons learnt from teams that make stuff.

## Metrics

The Maker Universe is a testing environment for new on-campus services and educational experiences. With our [metrics](./metrics/metrics.md) we aim to openly share what success would like for us. 

## Community

This Github repository is a knowledge base for students - supported by students. We are looking forward to your contributions in the form of pull requests.
